\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The wisdom, or intelligence, of a crowd, or a collection of intelligent agents, has long been an attractive topic with an ancient philosophic root and profound implications in a wide variety of disciplines, such as economics, political science, psychology, cognitive science, behavioural science, and many branches of social sciences.

While from a very different group of scientists, we deem the current artificial intelligence research,
signified the utmost by Deep Reinforcement Learning,
to carry previously underexplored potential for addressing such ``human'' problems beneath its theoretic branch,
with its deep roots in highly rigorous mathematics and formal logic,
as abstract models of universal intelligent agents shall apply to both artificial and natural agents alike.

In this provocative work, we introduce a theoretic model of intelligent crowds by
 a weighted mixture operation on
reinforcement learning agents, following the Legg-Hutter formulation of universal intelligent agents.
Then we derive a theoretic law governing the behavior of such a mixture, or crowd, that  
the expected total reward the mixture agent
gets in any environment is the corresponding weighted average
of the expected total rewards the original agents get in that
environment. Then we experimentally verify the validity of such predictions across a wide selection of reinforcement agents popular in modern reinforcement learning research. Additional theoretic results are ready for future work,
including a surprising one
 we call the genericness of non-deterministic intelligence.

 Beyond the technical results, by this paper we also hope to demonstrate how reinforcement learning can align more closely with more conventional scientific paradigms, as well as bring closer together other scientific communities with the reinforcement learning one, empowering all with the theories and tools from each other.

%. The mixture of several weighted agents is
%an agent with the
%following property: the expected total reward the mixture agent
%gets in any environment is the corresponding weighted average
%of the expected total rewards the original agents get in that
%environment. We use mixture agents to formalize and
%strengthen an informal result of Alexander and Hutter. We also use mixture
%agents to prove additional results, including a surprising result
%which we call the genericness of non-deterministic intelligence. Loosely:
%any particular non-deterministic action an agent takes
%can have its probabilities modified without making the agent less
%intelligent.
